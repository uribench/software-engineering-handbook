# GitHub

[GitHub][1] is a [Git][2] repository hosting service with many additional features, mainly 
supporting collaboration.

GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several 
collaboration features, such as [GitHub Pages][3], Wikis, and basic task management tools for 
projects.

GitHub simplifies collaboration by providing the following main features:

- **forking** - copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a 
project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 
- **pull request** - a notification you send to the original owner after you make changes that you’d 
like to share.
- **merge** - after reviewing the changes found in your repository, the owner can combine them with 
his repository.
